- ✅ No duplicate active check-ins allowed
- ✅ Distance stored in database
- ✅ Checkout calculates duration correctly
- ✅ History date filtering works (SQL injection prevented)
- ✅ Active check-in returns correct state

### 🐛 Bugs Found & Fixed (Phase 3)

1. **Bug #5:** Wrong status code (200 instead of 400) for validation
2. **Bug #6:** Column name mismatch preventing check-ins from saving
3. **Bug #7:** SQL injection vulnerability in date filters
4. **Bug #8:** SQLite-specific syntax issues breaking checkout

### 📝 Key Implementation Details

**Haversine Formula:**
```javascript
// Calculates distance between two GPS coordinates
calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) → distance in km
// Example: Gurugram Cyber City to Sector 44 = 7.22 km
```

**Distance Warning:**
```javascript
// Warns if user is >500m from client location
checkDistanceWarning(distance) → {shouldWarn, message}
```

**Database Schema Update:**
- Added `distance_from_client` REAL column to checkins table
- Stores calculated distance for audit trail

- ✅ SQL queries optimized (no N+1 issues)
- ✅ Date validation prevents future dates
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing data
- ✅ Performance requirements met (<100ms)

### 📝 Key Implementation Details

**SQL Optimization Examples:**

```sql
-- Dashboard Stats (3 optimized queries)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE manager_id = ? AND role = 'employee'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkins INNER JOIN users ON ... WHERE status = 'checked_in'  
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkins INNER JOIN users ON ... WHERE DATE(checkin_time) = TODAY

-- Daily Summary (2 queries total, no N+1)
-- Query 1: Team aggregates
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id), SUM(hours), AVG(distance) ...

-- Query 2: Per-employee breakdown with LEFT JOIN
SELECT u.*, COUNT(ch.id), SUM(hours) ...
FROM users u LEFT JOIN checkins ch ON u.id = ch.employee_id AND DATE = ?
GROUP BY u.id
```

**Role-Based Access:**
- All endpoints use `requireManager` middleware
- Manager can only view their direct reports
- Employee ID validation prevents cross-team access

**Performance:**
- Query execution time: <100ms
- Uses database aggregation functions
- Single query per data type (no loops)
