Subject: Full Stack Intern Assignment Submission - Kumkum

Dear Drishya,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment. I've completed the Field Force Tracker application and am submitting it for your review.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/unolo-field-force-tracker

Quick Setup:
1. Clone the repo
2. Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run init-db && npm start
3. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
4. Login with: manager@unolo.com / password123

What I Built:
- 13 REST API endpoints for auth, check-ins, and dashboard
- React frontend with GPS-based check-in system
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- 125 unit tests (87 backend + 38 frontend)
- Test coverage: 91% backend, 95% frontend

I found and fixed 10 bugs in the starter code, including a critical authentication issue and SQL injection vulnerabilities. All details are in the README and BUG_FIXES.md files.

Time spent: Approximately 2-3 days

I'm happy to discuss the implementation or walk through any part of the code. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Kumkum
