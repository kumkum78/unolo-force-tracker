# Bugs Fixed

Found these issues in the starter code:

- Missing `await` on bcrypt password check - login failing
- Password was in JWT token - security issue
- No validation on check-in requests
- SQL injection risks - switched to parameterized queries
- Wrong distance calculation formula
- Could check in at unassigned clients
- Multiple active check-ins allowed
- Foreign key violations
- CORS issues
- Missing error handling

Fixed while writing tests.
